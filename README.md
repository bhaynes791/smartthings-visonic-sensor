# smartthings-visonic-sensor
An alternative device handler for Visonic MCT-340 contact sensor

The sensor can be easily modified to use as
  - leak sensor
  - wired smoke detector
  - tilt sensor, mailbox sensor, garage door sensor

With the handler, you can select the sensor type to match the modification made to the sensor.
Here are some snapshots when the sensors are being modified to different purposes.

Here included are simple instructions to modify visonic sensor to different sensors.


Instructions to modify visonic contact sensor to water/leak sensor
  - open the sensor and take out the battery and the motherboard, the case should be pretty easy to open by knife
  - locate the relay on the side, it has a clear plastic wrap around a wire. Make a cut in the middle and remove the broken plastic
  - bent the two wires downward, temporary put it back into case and mark the positions to drill holes

  - drill two holes on the case so the wires can go thru
  - put everything back together and you have the a water/leak sensor

Instructions to modify visonic contact sensor to wired smoke detector
If your house have wired smoke detector, you can modify the visonic sensor into a smoke detector. 
  - depend on the brand, purchase the smoke alarm relay corresponding to your brand
  
  
  - modify the visonic similar to what we did with water/leak sensor above
  - then connect the two wires from the sensor to the
