# smartthings-visonic-sensor
An alternative device handler for Visonic MCT-340 contact sensor

The sensor can be easily modified to use as
  - leak sensor
  - wired smoke detector
  - tilt sensor, mailbox sensor, garage door sensor

With the handler, you can select the sensor type to match the modification made to the sensor.
Here are some snapshots when the sensors are being modified to different purposes.

Here included are simple instructions to modify visonic sensor to different sensors.


Instruction to modify visonic contact sensor to water/leak sensor
  - open the sensor and take out the battery and the motherboard, the case should be pretty easy to open by knife
  - locate the relay on the side, it has a clear plastic wrap around a wire. Make a cut in the middle and remove the broken plastic
  - bent the two wires downward, temporary put it back into case and mark the positions to drill holes
  - drill two holes on the case so the wire can go thru
  - put everythings back and now the sensor become a water/leak sensor, test it by putting the sensor on top of drops of water so the wires touching the water
